# Erdtree Remembrances<br>
This archive is one autist's attempt to become all-knowing, and to share that knowledge in as neutral a way possible. To the best of my ability, I have consolidated un-modded screenshots of items, NPC dialogue, and context clues to help Elden Ring players understand the lore, and form their own views based on the available evidence.

Github is not the best way to view images, and I highly recommend downloading the archive and viewing the screenshots using image viewer software (I used Windows Photo Viewer). 

**Neutrality**<br>
The first three folders ("Main Storyline", "NPC Quests" and "Items and Landmarks") are generally organized according to chronological order, or according to categories in the menus. 
In the subsequent folders (only "The Royals" at present) and in the "Equipment Set" folder under "Items and Landmarks", the screenshots are organized according to the best judgment of the archivist. While I have endeavoured to organize the screenshots neutrally, the exercise of my judgment may generate a misleading impression on the viewer. Accordingly, these folders have been labelled "Archivist" to reflect that. Some folders have been labelled "For consideration" when the main subject-matter is not explicitly mentioned but where I believe there are strong parallels (e.g. Godwyn and Mausoleums).

The archive is currently work-in-progress and will be updated erratically. Feel free to create your own archives and your own organization of screenshots using my work. I also welcome any information on missing screenshots, including missing items and missing dialogue (I'm well aware I'm missing many NPC kill/death quotes). Any screenshots you are able to share would also be greatly appreciated.

**Disclaimer**<br>
The archivist is a codelet. The history of commits will look stupid. Serial numbers are ordered according to natural sorting, not per Github's lexicographical ordering.
